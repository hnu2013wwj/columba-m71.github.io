## 毕业了

.

#### 不悔梦归处，只恨太匆匆

![graduated](/assets/img/graduated.png)

.

```
    Somewhere, a voice calls, in the depths of my heart
　　May I always be dreaming, the dreams that move my heart
　　
　　So many tears of sadness, uncountable through and through
　　I know on the other side of them I'll find you
　　
　　Everytime we fall down to the ground we look up to the blue sky above
　　We wake to it's blueness, as for the first time
　　
　　Though the road is long and lonely and the end far away, out of sight
　　I can with these two arms embrace the light
　　
　　As I bid farewell my heart stops, in tenderness I feel
　　My silent empty body begins to listen to what is real
　　
　　The wonder of living, the wonder of dying
　　The wind, town, and flowers, we all dance one unity
　　
　　Somewhere a voice calls in the depths of my heart
　　keep dreaming your dreams, don't ever let them part
　　
　　Why speak of all your sadness or of life's painful woes
　　Instead let the same lips sing a gentle song for you
　　
　　The whispering voice, we never want to forget,
　　in each passing memory always there to guide you
　　
　　When a miror has been broken, shattered pieces scattered on the ground
　　Glimpses of new life, reflected all around
　　
　　Window of beginning, stillness, new light of the dawn
　　Let my silent, empty body be filled and reborn
　　
　　No need to search outside, nor sail across the sea
　　Cause here shining inside me, it's right here inside me
　　
　　I've found a brightness, it's always with me
```
